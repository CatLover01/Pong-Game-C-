# Pong-Game-C-
This is pong. I don't need to explain it...

How to make it work?
  - Download all files
  - Open + build the solution (SFML should be included, Raldryniorth said that )
  - Run the program

More information
  - This is basically my first and last project using sfml which was really fun, I'm looking forward to continue next using unreal engine 5. Wish me luck and I hope to be able to see this code again in few years and laugh at it!! *hehe*
  Thanks to everyone that supported me and help me until the end, you kept me motivated! First 1 month, and I feel like I know a lot. 

*to be continued...*
